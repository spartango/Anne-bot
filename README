A Google Talk Robot with Eyes on Asana

Install 
-------

Anne uses bundler to get his deps. 
Use 'bundle install' to set things up

You'll need to provide gtalk credentials for Anne:

Fill in 
botUsername = ''
botPassword = ''
in bot/mcore.rb

You can customise malcolm's behavior in anne.rb

Run
---

Just execute run.sh

If you peek inside run.sh, you'll see that all it does is bundle exec, making
Anne something perfectly suitable for use on Heroku.
