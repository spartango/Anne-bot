Anne

@ Anand Gupta, 2012

A Google Talk Robot with Eyes on Asana

Install 
-------

Anne uses bundler to get her deps. 
Use 'bundle install' to set things up.

You'll need to provide Gtalk credentials for Anne:

Fill in: 
botUsername = ''
botPassword = ''

Anne also needs your Asana API key before you can use her.
Check out http://developer.asana.com

asanaKey    = ''

in bot/mcore.rb

You can customise Anne's behavior in anne.rb

Run
---

Just execute run.sh

If you peek inside run.sh, you'll see that all it does is bundle exec, making
Anne something perfectly suitable for use on Heroku.
